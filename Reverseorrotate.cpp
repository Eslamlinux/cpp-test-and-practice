/*
 The input is a string str of digits. Cut the string into chunks (a chunk here is a substring of the initial string) of size sz (ignore the last chunk if its size is less than sz).

If the sum of a chunk's digits is divisible by 2, reverse that chunk; otherwise rotate it to the left by one position. Put together these modified chunks and return the result as a string.

If

sz is <= 0 or if str == "" return ""
sz is greater (>) than the length of str it is impossible to take a chunk of size sz hence return "".
