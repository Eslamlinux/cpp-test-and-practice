/*
Oh no!
Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an sequence of strings!

You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.

Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.

ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]

Note that you can receive floats as well.
